  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: <span id="pp-date">November 2, 2025</span></p>

  <p>Day Counter ("the App") helps you track days to or since events and optionally configure a widget and reminders. We care about your privacy and strive to collect as little data as possible.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ads</strong>: The App uses Google AdMob to show ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers and approximate location (via IP) to deliver and measure ads. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">Google’s Advertising Policies</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong>: Google services may collect basic diagnostics (e.g., crash logs, performance data) to improve stability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account and does <strong>not</strong> collect your name, email address, or precise location.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the App’s features</li>
    <li>Deliver, measure, and improve advertising (via AdMob)</li>
    <li>Ensure performance and reliability</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App uses the following third‑party services, which have their own privacy policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google AdMob: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
    <li>Google Play Services: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Event data you create (names, dates, and options) are stored locally on your device. Advertising and diagnostic data are retained by Google according to their policies.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can limit ad personalization in your device settings (Google settings &gt; Ads).</li>
    <li>You can remove the App to stop all data collection by it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under the age where parental consent is required under applicable law. If you believe a child has provided data in violation of this policy, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date above and include the new policy in app updates.</p>
