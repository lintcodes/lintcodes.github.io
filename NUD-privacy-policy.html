  <p>Day Counter ("the App") helps you track days to or since events and optionally configure a widget and reminders. We
    care about your privacy and strive to collect as little data as possible.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Analytics</strong>: The App uses Firebase Analytics, a service provided by Google LLC, to understand how users interact with the app
        and
        to improve performance and user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firebase Analytics may collect non-personal information such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>App usage data (screens viewed, interactions)</li>
        <li>Device information (device model, OS version)</li>
        <li>Approximate location (derived from IP address)</li>
        <li>App instance identifiers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data is collected in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy.

      </p>

    </li>
    <li><strong>Ads</strong>: The App uses Google AdMob to show ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers and
      approximate location (via IP) to deliver and measure ads. See <a
        href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">Google’s Advertising Policies</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong>: Google services may collect basic diagnostics (e.g., crash logs, performance data)
      to improve stability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account and does <strong>not</strong> collect your name,
    email address, or precise location.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the App’s features</li>
    <li>Deliver, measure, and improve advertising (via AdMob)</li>
    <li>Ensure performance and reliability</li>
